This repository contains a demonstration of a common SQL error where the WHERE clause of a SELECT statement lacks a unique identifier, leading to unexpected query results when multiple records match the search criteria. The `bug.sql` file shows the problematic query, while `bugSolution.sql` presents the corrected version.  The issue arises when filtering data where multiple rows share the same values for the criteria in the WHERE clause. The database's handling of such cases isn't standardized, causing potential inconsistencies across database systems. The solution involves adding a primary key or unique identifier to the WHERE clause to ensure that only one record is retrieved when multiple records satisfy the condition.
